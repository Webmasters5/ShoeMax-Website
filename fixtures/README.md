## ⚙️ How to Use Fixtures

Before loading, make sure your virtual environment and migrations are up to date:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Then, load each fixture into your local database:

python manage.py loaddata fixtures/users/auth_users.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/customer/customers.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/brands.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/shoes.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/shoe_variants.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/orders.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/order_items.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/products/reviews.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/notifications/notifications.json


You can also load all fixtures at once:

python manage.py loaddata fixtures/*/*.json

These files were generated using:

python manage.py dumpdata app_name.ModelName --indent 4 > fixtures/app_name/filename.json


They are purely for testing and demonstration
